    "<h2>What is Chat-GPT?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent release of Chat GPT-4, many people are enthralled by the programs capabilities, and many are also expressing concerns regarding the implications that come with releasing a powerful AI open to use to anyone and everyone who desire it. What exactly is Chat-GPT? Chat GPT is an Artificial Intelligence chat bot developed and released by OpenAI, a research team of scientists and engineers working to further develop the capabilities of artificial intelligence. According to OpenAI Chat-GPT is powered by a deep learning model, which is a type of neural network designed to process and generate language. GPT learns by being fed large amounts of data and text which it processes and ‘learns’ to discuss and generate answers about that data in the same context in which it took in that data. "

    "<h2>Why is it important to discuss?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The advancement of powerful natural language processing technology has come rapidly, opening up possibilities for its users and empowering people to do more with their computers. Chat-GPT 4 has been used to aid education, programming work, day-to-day inquiries, and can even be used for data analysis. Recently, the AI powering Chat GPT-4 has been used to code entire programs, and even create falsified videos and audio files. While the capabilities of the new AI are certainly incredible, its release to the public in the form of a chat-bot has also caused concern amongst many. Some concerns include its unlimited access to information that can out match a human counterpart easily, and scifi-like concerns about its ability to become more powerful than humans and overpower us. While AI sounds like something that is bound to a computer screen, many governments, such as Germany, have started drafting legislation in response to the development of AI’s such as Chat-GPT 4. Powerful AIs, such as Chat-GPT are here and how it is perceived and used everyday will dictate how we move forward with the new technology. \n"

    "\n",
    "With Chat-GPT arguably being one of the most popular and most discussed releases of AI software in recent history we decided to center our data collection around tweets from the popular social media platform Twitter. Specifically, we focused on tweets containing the hashtag '#ChatGPT' starting from the initial launch of the OpenAI chatbot in November 2022 until February 24th, 2023. Our analysis revolves around the tweet's contents, the number of likes it received, and the number of retweets it accumulated. By assessing the overall sentiment of each tweet as either positive or negative, we aim to determine the general perception of Twitter users regarding Chat-GPT."
